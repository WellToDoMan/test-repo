# test-repo
I am making this README in Markdowns
## this is a level 2 heading
i can use simple text formatting to make **<strong>bold</strong>** or *<em>italics</em>* text
## this shows i am super cool and smart
now i am adding things onto a branch to be merged with the main branch. isn't that neat
